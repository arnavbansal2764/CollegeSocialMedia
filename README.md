## Overview

Welcome to our College Social Media Project! This project aims to provide a platform for college students to interact with each other and simultaneously connect with students from other colleges. The project is built using the following technologies:

1. **Express Js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

2. **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

3. **React Js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

4. **Socket IO**: A library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.

5. **Cors**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware for Express.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely.

- **Real-time Chat**: A real-time chat feature using Socket IO allows students to communicate instantly.
